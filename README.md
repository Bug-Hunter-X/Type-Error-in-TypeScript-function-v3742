This repo contains a demonstration of a common type error in TypeScript. The error arises when a function expecting a string argument is passed an array of strings. The solution involves modifying the function signature to accept an array of strings or adjusting how the function handles the input. The files bug.ts and bugSolution.ts demonstrate the bug and its solution.
